# iOS Integration Guide

This guide is for developers integrating Project Verify with their iOS applications.

## Background

Project Verify is a joint undertaking of the Mobile Authentication Taskforce. The taskforce provides customers with the ability to use their mobile phone number to sign into apps. Project Verify is built on top of OpenID Connect (OIDC).

### OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 specification. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that are obtained using OAuth 2.0 flows. You can read more about OIDC [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).

### Authorization Code Flow and Carrier Discovery

Project Verify SDK supports the authorization code flow for web and native applications. In the flow, the user is redirected to the carrier for authorization. Upon successful authorization, the user is redirected to your backend with an authorization code, which your backend exchanges for an ID token. This flow enhances security, as `clientId`, `clientSecret` and user ID token are not revealed to your client.

Because each carrier operates its own authorization servers, we determine the user's carrier prior to authentication. This process is called Carrier Discovery (this is an OIDC Discovery with extra parameters). This ensures that the discovery document from Project Verify is for the correct carrier.

### High Level Architecture

Project Verify brings the four main US phone carriers together with a common user authentication experience backed by carrier device authentication. The solution enables two main flows at initial launch (app and web). The app flow is for  service provider (SP) native apps or a SP-browser based websites that are on the same device as Project Verify. The web flow shows secondary device support when the SP website is accessed from a device other than a userâ€™s primary phone.

As the first image shows, consumers from their primary phone access Project Verify either from the SP app or SP website. As a service provider developer, you sign up and log in through the Project Verify portal, then write code in your backend. The architecture looks like this:

 <img src="image/high_level_flow_app_pri.png" alt="High Level Flow - App" width="550">

The flow goes from consumer through service provider website, to service provider backend, to mobile carrier, to Project Verify and back again.

As the second image shows, consumers from their secondary device (such as a laptop) can access Project Verify from the SP website. The architecture looks like this:

 <img src="image/high_level_flow_web_sec.png" alt="High Level Flow - Web" width="550">

The user receives a visual or numeric code with which to confirm their identity with their primary phone. Once they have done this  they can log in with their secondary device.

Consumer verification and authorization flows to Carrier auth, the service provider backend, Project Verify platform and mobile carrier as follows:

* Discovery
* Auth code request, universal link captured
* Sim and user authentication, explicit user consent (via the primary device)
* Auth code returned, deep or universal link
* Service provider integrated clients
* Token request
* Userinfo mobile carrier resource

## Getting Started

Before you integrate with Project Verify, register your application and obtain valid `clientId` and `clientSecret` from the portal or by contacting a Customer Operation Specialist. If you choose to use a custom redirect URI, then ensure that you specify a valid URI.  

### Open ID Connect Client

This SDK relies on *AppAuth* as an OIDC client. For more information about AppAuth, see the repository [here](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS).

### Pre-Release Git Access

While the SDK is under development, we recommend maintaining the Provider SDK source code as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule). If that is not possible, download the source [here](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios) and place it in your project directory.

```bash
git submodule add https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios
```

### Client Information and Scopes

Service providers decide how much client information they obtain from the user. In your setup, you can choose to have an experience with or without requiring a PIN or a biometric.

Since applications must get authorization to access user information, scopes are used to define allowed actions. Scopes are implemented via OIDC and can be set to request profile information (such as email address, name, phone) to verify users. OpenID is the only required scope and is added by default on every request. All others are optional depending on the needs of your application.

## Add Project Verify SDK

During development, include the ProjectVerifyLogin SDK in your project. There are currently two ways to integrate Project Verify (and its dependency `AppAuth`) in your project: via CocoaPods or as a git submodule. Carthage may be supported in the future.

### CocoaPods

You can include the ProjectVerifyLogin SDK in your project as a development CocoaPod. After you place the source code in your repository, add the following to your Podfile.

```ruby
  pod 'CarriersSharedAPI', path: '{your-relative-path}/CarriersSharedAPI.podspec'
```

Then run `pod install`. This adds the local source as well as `AppAuth` to your application's workspace.

### Carthage

More information coming soon - *Carthage* may be supported in the future.

### Adding Project Verify SDK Manually

You can add the ProjectVerifyLogin SDK to your project manually:

1. Retrieve the source for `ProjectVerifyLogin`. We recommend adding it as a [submodule](#pre-release-git-access).

2. After you clone the repository, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to recursively clone `AppAuth`.

3. If you cannot access submodules, then you must separately clone `AppAuth` and set your working copy to the release tag you would like to target. This SDK currently supports version [0.95.0](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/releases/tag/0.95.0).

## Configure Project Verify SDK

After you add the source via a submodule or manually, configure the Project Verify SDK as follows:

1. Add `CarriersSharedAPI.xcodeproj` to your application's Xcode project.

2. After adding the project, confirm that the deployment targets are less than or equal to your deployment target.

3. Ensure that `AppAuth` is linked to `CarriersSharedAPI` and included as a "Target Dependency" in the `CarrierSharedAPI` build phases.

4. View your project's "Embedded Binaries" under your project's "General" panel. Add both `AppAuth` and `CarriersSharedAPI` frameworks. Be sure to select the corresponding framework for the platform you are targeting (the iOS framework for an iOS target).

5. Build and run to ensure that everything is working correctly.

## Integration

To integrate Project Verify into your iOS application, configure your *Info.plist* with `ClientId` and instantiate Project Verify in your application delegate.  

### Configure Property List

Retrieve your application's `clientId` from the Project Verify dashboard. Add the following keys to *Info.plist* in your application:

```xml
	<key>ProjectVerifyClientId</key>
	<string>{your application's client id}</string>
	<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
			<string>Editor</string>
			<key>CFBundleURLName</key>
			<string>{your bundle id}</string>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>{your application's client id}</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>
```

### Using a Custom Redirect URI

If you would like to use universal links for your redirect scheme, it is possible to configure a custom URL scheme and a custom URL host.

The following keys are made available for you to customize the structure of the redirect URL:

```xml
    <key>ProjectVerifyCustomScheme</key>
    <string>{your application's custom scheme}</string>
    <key>ProjectVerifyCustomHost</key>
    <string>{your application's custom host}</string>
```

**Note:** For schemes other than `https`, you must add the scheme to your application's `CFBundleURLTypes` list.

Redirect URLs will require the universal links to route the following paths to the application: `/authorize` and `/discoveryui`.
For more information about universal links, read Apple's [documentation on the topic](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/enabling_universal_links).

#### Project Verify Redirects

We recommend that you use either the default URL scheme (your Project Verify client ID) or a universal linking scheme to support Project Verify redirects. Other URL schemes may be owned by other applications and can introduce unexpected behavior. For more information, view [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app) on defining a custom URL scheme.

## Instantiate Project Verify

To support Project Verify, you must instantiate Project Verify in your application delegate:

```swift
import CarriersSharedAPI

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication,
     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        ProjectVerifyAppDelegate.shared.application(
            application,
            didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions
        )

        // Perform additional application setup.

        return true
    }

    func application(_ app: UIApplication,
                     open url: URL,
                     options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {

        guard !ProjectVerifyAppDelegate.shared.application(app, open: url, options: options) else {
            return true
        }
        // Perform any other URL processing your app may need to perform.
        return true
    }
}
```

## Request Authorization Code

The SDK provides a branded button called `ProjectVerifyAuthorizationButton` that automatically handles Project Verify authorization.

### Add Verify Button

Add the Project Verify  `ProjectVerifyAuthorizationButton` to your UIView.

```swift
import CarriersSharedAPI

class LoginViewController {
    let projectVerifyButton = ProjectVerifyAuthorizationButton()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let scopes: [Scope] = [.profile, .email]
        projectVerifyButton.scopes = scopes
        projectVerifyButton.delegate = self

        view.addSubview(projectVerifyButton)
    }
}
```

#### Dark Button

You can customize the appearance of the button. A dark button style is appropriate to use with light backgrounds. By default, the Project Verify button uses the dark style specified as follows:

```swift
    projectVerifyButton
```
The dark button style looks like this:

 <img src="image/verify_button_dark.png" alt="Verify Button Dark" width="360">

#### Light Button

A light button style is appropriate to use with dark backgrounds. For the light style, add the light parameter specified as follows:

```swift
    projectVerifyButton.style = .light
```
The light button style looks like this:

<img src="image/verify_button_light.png" alt="Verify Button Light" width="360">

### Receive Callbacks

In order to receive the outcome of your Project Verify request, implement the `ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButtonDelegate` and handle the events.

```swift
extension LoginViewController: ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButtonDelegate {

    func buttonWillBeginAuthorizing(_ button: ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButton) {
        // perform any ui updates like showing an activity indicator.
    }

    func buttonDidFinish(
        _ button: ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButton,
        withResult result: AuthorizationResult) {

        // handle the outcome of the request:
        switch result {
        case .code(let authorizedResponse):
            let code = authorizedResponse.code
            let mcc = authorizedResponse.mcc
            let mnc = authorizedResponse.mnc
            // pass these identifiers to your secure server to perform a token request
        case .error:
            // handle the error case appropriately
        case .cancelled:
            // perform any work required when the user cancels
        }
    }
}
```

### Request Parameters

There are several parameters that you may wish to configure for your authorization request, as noted in this section.

#### Scopes

By default, authorization requests made with the Project Verify SDK include the `OpenId` scope. To use additional scopes, set them on the button and they will be added to the request.

```swift
    let scopes: [Scope] = [.profile, .email]
```

For more information, see [Scope.swift](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios/blob/develop/CarriersSharedAPI/Sources/Core/Scope.swift).

#### Additional Parameters

Additionally, it is possible to configure the following parameters:

* ACR Values
* Request State
* Nonce
* Correlation Id
* Context
* Prompt

For more information about each of these parameters and instructions on how to use them, view the documentation for the `ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButton`.

## Request Authorization Code Manually

For a more hands-on approach, you can perform a manual authorization request with `AuthorizationService`.
Pass the code and associated identifiers to your secure server to complete the token request flow.

```swift
import CarriersSharedAPI

class LoginViewController {

    let authService = AuthorizationService()

    func loginWithProjectVerify() {
        // in response to some UI, perform an authorization using the AuthorizationService
        let scopes: [Scope] = [.profile, .email]
        authService.authorize(
            scopes: scopes,
            fromViewController: self) { result in

            switch result {
            case .code(let authorizedResponse):
                let code = authorizedResponse.code
                let mcc = authorizedResponse.mcc
                let mnc = authorizedResponse.mnc
                // pass these identifiers to your secure server to perform a token request
            case .error:
                // handle the error case appropriately
            case .cancelled:
                // perform any work required when the user cancels
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Refer to:
* [Submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)
* [ProjectVerifyLogin](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios)
* [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS)

## Error Handling

`AuthorizationError` defines the `ErrorType`, `code`, `description` and `errorType` to help the developer debug the error, as well present a description to the user. The `Error Type` identifies a class of error during the Authorization flow, such as`invalidRequest` or `requestDenied`. The developer can include further information, with `code` adding context for the origin of the error, `description` a possible explanation, and `errorType` a possible remedy.

The following table summarizes the type of errors associated with an `AuthorizationError` code and how to manage them.

| Error Type (Case) | Possible Cause | How to Remedy |
:------------------ | :------------- | :------------ |
| invalidRequest | The request made is invalid. | Check the parameters passed to the authorization call. |
| requestDenied | The request was denied by the user or carrier. | Display an appropriate feedback message to the user. |
| requestTimeout | The request has timed out. | Display an appropriate feedback message, such as "Unable to reach the server, please try again" or "Poor network connection". |
| serverError | There was an error on the server. | Please try again later. |
| networkFailure | There was a problem communicating over the network. | Check your connection and try again. |
| conifigurationError | There is an error configuring the SDK. | Confirm your configuration locally and with the service provider portal. |
| discoveryStateError | There is an inconsistency with the user's state. | Try to log in again to the application. |
| unknownError | An unknown error has occurred. | If the problem persists, contact support. |

## Next Steps

On your secure server, perform discovery and use the discovered token endpoint to request an access token from Project Verify with the processes already detailed:

* Auth Code
* MCC (Mobile Country Code)
* MNC (Mobile Network Code)

The token should be used as the basis for accessing or creating a token within the domain of your application. After you exchange the authorization code for an authorization token on your secure server, you will be able to access the Project Verify User Info Endpoint, which should pass information through your server's authenticated endpoints in a way that makes sense for your application.
