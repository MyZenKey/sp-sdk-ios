# iOS Integration Guide

This guide is for developers integrating Project Verify into their iOS applications.

## Background

Project Verify is a joint undertaking of the Mobile Authentication Taskforce. The taskforce provides customers with the ability to use their mobile phone number to sign into apps. Project Verify is built on top of OpenID Connect (OIDC).

### OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0  specification. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that are obtained using OAuth 2.0 flows. You can read more about OIDC [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).

### Authorization Code Flow and MNO Discovery

Project Verify SDK supports the authorization code flow for web and native applications. In the flow, the user is redirected to Mobile Network Operator (MNO) for authorization. Upon successful authorization, the user is redirected to your backend with an authorization code, which your backend exchanges for an ID token. This flow enhances security, as `clientId`, `clientSecret` and user ID token are not revealed to your client.

Because each carrier operates its own authorization servers, we determine the user's MNO prior to authentication. This process is called MNO Discovery (MNO Discovery is an OIDC discovery with extra parameters). MNO Discovery returns the OIDC of the user's MNO. This ensures that the discovery document from Project Verify is for the correct MNO.

### High Level Architecture

Project Verify brings the four main US phone carriers together with a common user authentication experience backed by carrier device authentication. The solution enables two main flows at initial launch (app and web). The app flow is for  service provider (SP) native apps or a SP-browser based websites that are on the same device as Project Verify. The web flow shows secondary device support when the SP website is accessed from a device other than a userâ€™s primary phone.

As the first image shows, consumers from their primary phone access Project Verify either from the SP app or SP website. As a service provider developer, you sign up and log in thru the Project Verify portal, then write code in your backend. The architecture looks like this:

 <img src="image/high_level_flow_app_pri.png" alt="High Level Flow - App" width="550">

The flow goes from consumer thru service provider website to service provider backend to mobile carrier to Project Verify and back.

As the second image shows, consumers from their secondary device (such as a laptop) can access Project Verify from the SP website. The architecture looks like this:

 <img src="image/high_level_flow_web_sec.png" alt="High Level Flow - Web" width="550">

The user receives a visual or numeric code with which to confirm their identity with their primary phone. Once they have done this  they can log in with their secondary device

Consumer verification and authorization flows to MNO auth, the service provider backend, Project Verify platform and mobile carrier as follows:

* discovery
* auth code request, universal link captured
* sim and user authentication, explicit user consent (via the primary device)
* auth code returned, deep or universal link
* service provider integrated clients
* token request
* userinfo mobile carrier resource

## Getting Started

Before you integrate with Project Verify, you need to register an application and obtain valid `clientId` and `clientSecret` from the Portal or by contacting a Customer Operation Specialist. If you choose to use a custom redirect URI, then ensure that you specify a valid URI.  

### Open ID Connect Client

This SDK relies on *AppAuth* as an Open Id Connect client.
For more information about AppAuth, see the repository [here](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS).

### Pre-Release Git Access

While the SDK is under development, we recommend maintaining the Provider SDK source code as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule). If that is not possible, download the source [here](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios) and place it in your project directory.

```bash
git submodule add https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios
```

### Client Information and Scopes

Service providers decide how much client information they obtain from the user. In your setup, you can choose to have an experience with or without requiring a PIN or a biometric.

Since applications must get authorization to access user information, scopes are used to define allowed actions. Scopes are implemented by the OpenID Connect protocol and can be set to request profile information (email address, name, phone ...) to verify users. OpenID is the only required scope and is added by default on every request. All others are optional depending on the needs of your application.

## Add Project Verify SDK

During development, include the ProjectVerifyLogin SDK in your project. There are currently two ways to integrate Project Verify (and its dependency `AppAuth`) in your project: as a submodule of CocoaPods or manually. Additionally, Carthage may be supported in the future.

### CocoaPods

You can include the ProjectVerifyLogin SDK in your project as a development Cocoapod. After you place the source code in your repository, add the following to your Podfile.

```ruby
  pod 'CarriersSharedAPI', path: '{your-relative-path}/CarriersSharedAPI.podspec'
```

Then run `pod install`. This adds the local source as well as `AppAuth` to your application's workspace.

### Carthage

More information coming soon - *Carthage* may be supported in the future.

### Adding Project Verify SDK Manually

You can add the ProjectVerifyLogin SDK to your project manually. For an example of a project that links ProjectVerifyLogin manually, see  [SocialApp](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios/tree/develop/Example/SocialApp).

1. Retrieve the source for `ProjectVerifyLogin`. We recommend adding it as a [submodule](#pre-release-git-access).

2. After you clone the repository, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to recursively clone `AppAuth`.

3. If you cannot access submodules, then you must separately clone `AppAuth` and set your working copy to the release tag you would like to target. This SDK currently supports version [0.95.0](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/releases/tag/0.95.0).

## Configure Project Verify SDK

After you add the source via submodule or manually, then configure the Project Verify SDK as follows:

1. Add `CarriersSharedAPI.xcodeproj` to your application's Xcode project.

2. After adding the project, confirm that the deployment targets are less than or equal to your deployment target.

3. Ensure that `AppAuth` is linked to `CarriersSharedAPI` and included as a "Target Dependency" in the `CarrierSharedAPI` build phases.

4. View your project's "Embedded Binaries" under your project's "General" panel. Add both `AppAuth` and `CarriersSharedAPI` frameworks. Be sure to select the corresponding framework for the platform you're targeting (the iOS framework for an iOS target).

Build and run to ensure that everything is working correctly.

## Integration

To integrate Project Verify into your iOS application, configure your Info.plist with ClientId and instantiate Project Verify in your application delegate.  

### Configure Property List

Retrieve your application's `clientId` from the Project Verify dashboard. Add the following keys to Info.plist in your application:

```xml
	<key>ProjectVerifyClientId</key>
	<string>{your application's client id}</string>
	<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
			<string>Editor</string>
			<key>CFBundleURLName</key>
			<string>{your bundle id}</string>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>{your application's client id}</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>
```

For examples of how to configure the property list, see the [Social App](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios/tree/develop/Example/SocialApp), and [Bank App](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios/tree/develop/Example/BankApp).

### Using a Custom Redirect URI

If you would like to use universal links for your redirect scheme, it is possible to configure a custom URL scheme and a custom URL host.

The following keys are made available for you to customize the structure of the redirect URL:

```xml
    <key>ProjectVerifyCustomScheme</key>
    <string>{your application's custom scheme}</string>
    <key>ProjectVerifyCustomHost</key>
    <string>{your application's custom host}</string>
```

**Note:** For schemes other than `https`, you must add the scheme to your application's `CFBundleURLTypes` list.

For an example of how to configure property lists for these custom keys, see the [Photo App](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios/tree/develop/Example/PhotoApp).

Redirect URLs will require the universal links to route the following paths to the application: `/authorize` and `/discoveryui`.
For more information about universal links, read Apple's [documentation on the topic](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/enabling_universal_links).

#### Project Verify Redirects

We recommend that you use either the default URL scheme (your Project Verify client ID) or a universal linking scheme to support Project Verify redirects. Other URL schemes may be owned by other applications and can introduce unexpected behavior. For more information, view [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app) on defining a custom URL scheme.

## Instantiate Project Verify

To support Project Verify, you must instantiate Project Verify in your application delegate:

```swift
import CarriersSharedAPI

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication,
     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        ProjectVerifyAppDelegate.shared.application(
            application,
            didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions
        )

        // Perform additional application setup.

        return true
    }

    func application(_ app: UIApplication,
                     open url: URL,
                     options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {

        guard !ProjectVerifyAppDelegate.shared.application(app, open: url, options: options) else {
            return true
        }
        // Perform any other URL processing your app may need to perform.
        return true
    }
}
```

## Request Authorization Code

The SDK provides a branded button called `ProjectVerifyAuthorizationButton` that automatically handles Project Verify authorization.

### Add Verify Button

Add the Project Verify  `ProjectVerifyAuthorizationButton` to your UIView.

```swift
import CarriersSharedAPI

class LoginViewController {
    let projectVerifyButton = ProjectVerifyAuthorizationButton()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let scopes: [Scope] = [.profile, .email]
        projectVerifyButton.scopes = scopes
        projectVerifyButton.delegate = self

        view.addSubview(projectVerifyButton)
    }
}
```
For examples of how the button works with both Interface Builder and Autolayout, see the example [Branding Project](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios/tree/develop/Example/ProjectVerifyBranding).

#### Dark Button

You can customize the appearance of the button. A dark button style is appropriate to use with light backgrounds. By default, the Project Verify button uses the dark style specified as follows:

```swift
    projectVerifyButton
```
The dark button style looks like this:

 <img src="image/verify_button_dark.png" alt="Verify Button Dark" width="360">

#### Light Button

A light button style is appropriate to use with dark backgrounds. For the light style, add the light parameter specified as follows:

```swift
    projectVerifyButton.style = .light
```
The light button style looks like this:

<img src="image/verify_button_light.png" alt="Verify Button Light" width="360">

### Receive Callbacks

In order to receive the outcome of your Project Verify request, implement the `ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButtonDelegate` and handle the events.

```swift
extension LoginViewController: ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButtonDelegate {

    func buttonWillBeginAuthorizing(_ button: ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButton) {
        // perform any ui updates like showing an activity indicator.
    }

    func buttonDidFinish(
        _ button: ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButton,
        withResult result: AuthorizationResult) {

        // handle the outcome of the request:
        switch result {
        case .code(let authorizedResponse):
            let code = authorizedResponse.code
            let mcc = authorizedResponse.mcc
            let mnc = authorizedResponse.mnc
            // pass these identifiers to your secure server to perform a token request
        case .error:
            // handle the error case appropriately
        case .cancelled:
            // perform any work required when the user cancels
        }
    }
}
```

### Request Parameters

There are several parameters that you may wish to configure for your authorization request:

#### Scopes

By default, authorization requests made with the Project Verify SDK include the OpenId scope. To use additional scopes, set them on the button and they will be added to the request.

```swift
    let scopes: [Scope] = [.profile, .email]
```

For more information, see [Scope.swift](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios/blob/develop/CarriersSharedAPI/Sources/Core/Scope.swift).

#### Additional Parameters

Additionally it is possible to configure the following parameters:

- ACR Values
- Request State
- Nonce
- Correlation Id
- Context
- Prompt

For more information about each of these parameters and instructions on how to use them, view the documentation for the `ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButton`.

## Request Authorization Code Manually

For a more hands-on approach, you can perform a manual authorization request with `AuthorizationService`.
Pass the code and associated identifiers to your secure server to complete the token request flow.

```swift
import CarriersSharedAPI

class LoginViewController {

    let authService = AuthorizationService()

    func loginWithProjectVerify() {
        // in response to some UI, perform an authorization using the AuthorizationService
        let scopes: [Scope] = [.profile, .email]
        authService.authorize(
            scopes: scopes,
            fromViewController: self) { result in

            switch result {
            case .code(let authorizedResponse):
                let code = authorizedResponse.code
                let mcc = authorizedResponse.mcc
                let mnc = authorizedResponse.mnc
                // pass these identifiers to your secure server to perform a token request
            case .error:
                // handle the error case appropriately
            case .cancelled:
                // perform any work required when the user cancels
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* [submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)
* [projectVerifyLogin](https://git.xcijv.net/sp-sdk/sp-sdk-ios)
* [appAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS)


## Next Steps

On your secure server, you perform discovery and use the discovered token endpoint to request an access token from Project Verify with the processes already detailed:

* Auth Code
* MCC
* MNC

The token should be used as the basis for accessing or creating a token within the domain of your application. After you exchange the authorization code for an authorization token on your secure server, you will be able to access the Project Verify User Info Endpoint.

The Project Verify User Info Endpoint should pass information through your server's authenticated endpoints in a way that makes sense for your application.


# Example Apps

There are several example apps which demonstrate different pieces of project verify functionality. These flows demonstrate how to make a request for a set of scopes from Project Verify and demonstrate how that information might be transported back to your server. These flows mock and simplify the server contract, which will ultimately be up to you to implement. For guidance on how to implement Project Verify on the server, see the [Project Verify Web Integration Guidelines]().

## SocialApp (iOS)

This app simulates a social network. It demonstrates:
- Signing in with Project Verify.
- Signing up with Project Verify.
- How to use the ProjectVerifyAuthorizeButton.

A social network might leverage Project Verify to make registration and login easier for the user. The sign up / sign in flow is comprised of the social network requesting the necessary scopes from Project Verify. The social app receives an authorization code and mcc/mnc identifer from Project Verify. It passes this back to the mock social app server where the assumption would be that the token exchange is completed. Once the server has a token, it can access the user info endpoint for the information authorized in the scopes.

## BankApp (iOS)

This app simulates a banking app. It demonstrates:
- How to link Project Verify to an existing user account.
- How to use Project Verify as a second factor to authorize a transaction.

A bank or financial institution might leverage Project Verify to provide a second factor for large or risky transactions. The authorization flow demonstrates how to request the second factor scope to authorize a money transfer. The bank app receives an authorization code and mcc/mnc identifer from Project Verify. It passes this back to the mock bank app server where the assumption would be that the token exchange is completed. Once the server has a token, it can proceed with the transaction with the knowledge that the user has provided the second factor authorization.

## PhotoApp (iOS)

This app simulates a commerce app. It demonstrates:
- How to use Project Verify to fill out a form.
- How to configure custom redirect URLs.

An e-commerce app might leverage Project Verify to retrieve user information from a trusted source before the user has created a profile. The social app demonstrates how to authorize the required scopes to complete a form. The photo app receives an authorization code and mcc/mnc identifer from Project Verify. It passes this back to the mock photo app server where the assumption would be that the token exchange is completed. Once the server has a token, it can access the user info endpoint for the information authorized in the scopes.

## Branding Guidelines (iOS)

This app has some simple UI to showcase Project Verify branding guidelines. It demonstrates how to layout the branded buttons using different UI paradigms.
