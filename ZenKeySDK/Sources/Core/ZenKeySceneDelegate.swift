/// This class represents the entry point for the application and mirrors the behavior of
/// UIApplication's UIWindowSceneDelegate type. This property should be accessed via its `shared`
/// singleton instance to ensure there is only one instance per application.
///
/// There is one method
/// that consumers are responsible for forwarding in the UIApplicationDelegate type:
///
/// `scene(_:openURLContexts:)`
///
/// - SeeAlso: UIWindowSceneDelegate
@available(iOS 13.0, *)

    /// which URLs remain unhandled. You should take steps to ensure that you only handle your
    /// own URLs in your SceneDelegate's `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - scene: The current UIScene instance received by your application's SceneDelegate
    ///   - session: The scene session received by your application's SceneDelegate
